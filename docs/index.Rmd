### Background

##### Brief Introduction: 
The rapid proliferation of the red encrusting macroalgal *Ramicrusta* in the Caribbean is raising concerns about its ecological impacts, particularly its ability to outcompete foundational benthic species, inhibit invertebrate recruitment, and overgrow living coral colonies, often leading to coral mortality (Eckrich & Engel, 2013; Edmunds et al., 2019). Coral genera exhibit varying levels of susceptibility to *Ramicrusta* colonization, with *Orbicella* sp. among the most vulnerable and experiencing high alga overgrowth rates (Hollister et al., 2021; Fig. 1). 
  
There's been considerable evidence illustrating  *Ramicrusta's* tendency to interact with and overgrow live corals (Eckrich & Engel, 2013; Ballantine et al., 2016; Edmunds et al., 2019; Hollister et al., 2021), yet there remains a disconnect when it comes to understanding the factors contributing to this relationship. As macroalgal growth is generally restricted by nutrient availability, particulary in these oligotrophic water, I hypothesize that *Ramicrusta* may be deriving nutrients from the coral itself, fueling these interactions and promoting its own growth.

##### Application of Stable Isotope Analysis:

Based on predictable isotope fractionation patterns (Fry, 1988), the ability of the alga to remineralize coral nutrients can be evaluated through bulk stable isotope analyses. Fractionation refers to the preferential use of the lighter isotope (<sup>12</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>N) during metabolic processes, concentrating the heavier form in the organism’s tissues (<sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N) (Rounick & Winterbourn, 1986; Fry, 1988; Cohen & Fong, 2004). In heterotrophic consumers, the ratio of heavy to light isotopes for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) generally enrich by 1‰ and 3‰  per trophic level, respectively (Fry, 1988). These ratios, or isotope signatures, are represented by the delta notation in parts per thousand ($\delta^{13}$C, $\delta^{15}$N). This unique aspect of isotope fractionation provides insight into a consumer's food source ($\delta^{13}$C)  and trophic position ($\delta^{15}$N) (Rounick & Winterbourn, 1986; Post et al., 2002).  However, primary producers typically exhibit a lack of fractionation (Gartner et al., 2002; Cohen & Fong, 2004; Strait et al., 2021). Thus, both the C and N signatures generally reflect their source. As a result, macroalgal bioassays serve as powerful proxies for nutrient studies in oligotrophic environments because tissue analyses can trace nutrient sourcing ($\delta^{13}$C, $\delta^{15}$N), availability (C%, N%), and limitations (C:N) in the surrounding water (Amato et al., 2016; Amato et al., 2018; Strait et al., 2021). 

In theory, if *Ramicrusta* species are remineralizing coral tissues, the C and N isotope signatures and percentage of the algae should be higher due to the trophic enrichment (Fry, 1988; Muscatine et al., 2005). Additionally, the C and N percentages may be enhanced in the alga as a result of additional nutrients derived from the coral tissue, which would, in turn, reduce nutrient limitations and lower the C:N ratio. (Amato et al., 2016). However, baseline tissue nutrient analyses on the genus *Ramicrusta* are lacking; therefore, we will need to include two upright geniculate calcifying macroalgae species into our sampling to offer context into *Ramicrusta's* nutrient parameters. The rhizophytic green alga *Halimeda opuntia* and epilithic red alga *Jania adhereans* will be prioritized because they are prominent calcifiers within the region and their nutrient contents have been established for oligotrophic reef systems (Fong et al., 2003; Koch et al., 2023). 

The following are the preliminary methods, results, and conclusions from a pilot study conducted on September 3, 2024.

### Methods

##### Site Description: 

Sample collection occurred on the leeward side of Flat Cay, an offshore 9 m depth reef along the southwest side of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands (Fig. 2). This site was selected because of its high abundance of *R. textilis* (46.0% ± 5.9; Hollister et al., 2021) and high frequency of interactions between the alga and *Orbicella annularis* (personal observation). To characterize the abiotic conditions during algal and coral sampling, a temperature logger (Hobo Pendant) and PAR meter were deployed a month prior to the collection time and retrieved on the final day of sampling.

  <figcaption><small>Fig. 2: Algal collection occurred on September 2, 2024 on the leeward side of Flat Cay, St. Thomas, a 9 m depth aggregated reef. Effects of remineralization may have been masked by the high nitrogen content found in all alga species, thus Fortuna Bay and Flat Cay windward were marked as future resampling sites because of the considerably low growth rates of *R. textilis* on bare substrate when compared to *O. annularis* at these locations (Hollister et al., 2021).</small></figure>

##### Alga Collection: 

Open-circuit SCUBA was used for all algal collections. Replicates of each algal sample was randomly collected by hand,  with a minimum of five meters between samples. The apical regions of *H. opuntia* and *J. adhaerens* (~ 5 cm) were cleanly removed from its thallus (n = 10 samples per species). *R. textilis* was collected from ten rocks (control; n = 10) and ten *O. annualaris* colonies that appeared visually healthy. For each substrate, *R. textilis* was brushed of epiphytes and chiseled at two locations from the same contiguous alga thallus (n = 2 *R. textilis* samples per substrate). One sample was collected from the margin of algal growth and the other was at a linear distance away from the margin, with distances between samples measured (~ 2 to 3 cm) and photographed (Fig. 3). This sampling strategy will distinguish the alga’s nutrient parameters during direct interaction with living coral to those in non-interacting regions, with the algal samples from bare substrate serving as controls for both conditions. Algal replicates will be placed in individual plastic bags at depth with ambient seawater. Samples will be transported to the laboratory in a dark container to minimize physiological stress and processed immediately.

##### Isotope Preparation:

Macroalgae were rinsed with deionized water (DI) to remove any external contaminants (i.e., invertebrates and epiphytes) and thoroughly dried with paper towels (Strait et al., 2021). Samples were loosely parceled in combusted aluminum foil with each sample code and dried at 60℃ to constant weight in a drying oven (24-36 hours). With a clean mortar and pestle (ethanol and DI rinse between samples), algae were ground to a fine powder and carefully packaged in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (Strait et al., 2021). Stable isotope analyses were processed by an Elemental Analyzer Delta V at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa. Dual stable isotope analyses were performed because acidification has the potential to degrade $\delta^{15}$N and unaltering calcified tissue can skew $\delta^{13}$C (Strait & Spalding, 2021). 

##### Data Analysis:

All data were tested for homogeneity and normality. Log transformations were used when data violated ANOVA assumptions. Tissue nutrients ($\delta^{15}$N, % N, and C:N) were assessed using two-factor ANOVA (factors: Substrate, Growth Region, and the interaction of the two). Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc test was applied to show pairwise comparisons, with distinct letters on graphs denoting significant differences.

A two-factor ANOVA with a log transformation revealed significant differences in the N signatures of *Ramicrusta*  for substrate type (p-value = 0.04978) and growth region (p-value = 0.01112), with no significant interaction effect between the two factors. Marginal (mean $\delta^{15}$N ± SEM = 1.66 ‰ ± 0.10) and non-marginal (mean $\delta^{15}$N ± SEM = 1.81 ‰ ± 0.06) samples of *R. textilis* growing on *O. annularis* had higher N signatures compared to their corresponding controls (mean $\delta^{15}$N ± SEM = 1.36 ‰ ± 0.13 and 1.78 ‰ ± 0.13, respectively; Fig. 5). Nitrogen signatures were consistently lower in marginal samples than in non-marginal samples across both substrates.

In contrast, the N content of *R. textilis* exhibited the opposite pattern observed in the alga's $\delta^{15}$N values for substrate type and growth region. The marginal algal samples collected from *O. annularis* colonies had significantly higher N percentages than the non-marginal replicates (two-factor ANOVA with a Tukey HSD; p-value = 0.0026933), while no difference was observed between the two regions on bare substrate (Fig. 6). Although a two-factor ANOVA only revealed differences in N content for growth region and not substrate type, the alga did demonstrate significant difference between the alga's marginal samples on *O. annularis* when compared to the non-marginal replicates for both substrate types. Additionally, there was a nearly significant difference between the N content of *R. textilis* on *O. annularis* (mean % N ± SEM = 0.462 % ± 0.022) and bare substrate (mean % N ± SEM = 0.395 % ±	0.025) when isolating marginal replicates (one-factor ANOVA; p-value = 0.0671), while N percentages were nearly equivalent for the non-marginal thalli across substrate type.

The C:N ratio was significantly lower on *O. annularis* colonies (mean C:N ± SEM = 15.21 ± 0.47) when compared to bare substrate (mean C:N ± SEM = 17.72 ± 0.57), with no differences detected for growth region or the interaction of the main effects (Fig. 7). Since the N percentages of the alga's non-marginal samples were consistent across substrate types, the disparity between the C:N was likely driven by higher carbon content observed in the alga growing on bare substrate (mean % C ± SEM = 5.954% ±	0.479) versus the coral colonies (mean % C ± SEM = 5.030% ±	0.331; Fig. 8). In contrast, the C content was fairly similar in the alga's apical region for each substrate (control substrate = 6.861% ± 0.413; coral substrate = 6.9103% ± 0.320; Fig. 8); indicting that the difference in C:N may be attributed to the high N found in the alga encrusting over the *O. annularis*.

##### Brief Conclusion: 

These results could support the hypothesis that *Ramicrusta* has the ability to remineralize coral nutrients as it colonizes coral colonies. Because of isotopic fractionation during metabolic events in heterotrophic consumers, the significantly higher N signatures found in the alga overgrowing *O. annularis*  may have been a result of coral-derived nutrients. However, it was anticipated that the highest N signatures would occur when the alga was directly interacting with live coral tissue. Additionally, apical regions of a thallus generally have enriched d15N value because the high N demand associated with new growth reduces N species selection, while the N supply available for older portions of the thallus increases relative to it's demand (Umezawa et al., 2007). As this is the first isotopic study conducted on the genus *Ramicrusta*, it's difficult to interpret these snapshots of nutrient profiles when nutrient histories for the taxon is lacking. However, there are some palusible causes for this unexpected result. 

First, physiological stress disrupts the coral-symbiont relationship, as seen in bleaching events where corals expel symbionts under heat stress. Competition can also trigger symbiont expulsion, disrupting nitrogen recycling. Typically, corals exhibit low δ¹⁵N values because symbionts retain ¹⁴N within the holobiont. However, expelling dinoflagellates releases ¹⁴N as ammonium into the water. This ammonium leakage may explain the low δ¹⁵N values observed in Ramicrusta during coral competition.



the difference in the N signatures marginal and non-marginal alga samples collected frmo *Orbicella* suggests  There are ___ plausible causes for this unexpected results.  

However, even under N saturated states, macroalgae generally assimiliate 14N and 15N in direct proportion (Fong et al., 2004; Fong et al., 2005), thus the difference found in the marginal and non-marginal alga samples collected from *O. annularis* colonies may still suggest N remineralization. There are two plausible causes for this unexpected results. 

- First, physioloigcal stress in coral's leads 
- First, stark white coral skeleton was observed under all the non-marginal alga samples from *Orbicella* colonies, providing evidence this region of the alga was once overgrowing living tissue. Based on Hollister et al. (2021) measurements for the alga's growth on *O. annularis* (15 mm/year) combined with the linear distance between the marginal and non-marginal samples from this study (mean distance = 25 mm), it is inferred that this area was likely around 1.5 years old. Typically, older portions of algal thalli have lower $\delta^{15}$N values because the slower growth rates (i.e., less N demand) increases the relative N supply, thus selection for N species may be 

based on the fact that the non-marginal samples collected from *Orbicella* colonies were at some point overgrowing living tissue since 

Even though the N signatures were enriched in *R. textilis* tissues extracted from coral colonies, the consistently lower N signatures observed in the alga's apical regions across both substrates 
Thoughts: 
- Healthy macroalgae can release isotopically light N compounds when N-saturated; however, the mechanisms governing this process are less understood. 
- There is a relative increase in the N supply as growth demand decreases. Thus, the non-marginal replicates 
- 

The striking disparity between the marginal and non-marginal N percentages in the alga overgrowing *O. annularis* colonies, compared to the control substrates, indicates a possible additional influx of nitrogen where the alga is actively encrusting over the coral.
